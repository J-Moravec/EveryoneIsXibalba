## Story
The underworld land Xibalba is in turmoil. The seven rulers of Xibalba decided to play their traditional ballgame once again, but without the twin-heroes to compete against, they played against each other. As each of the rulers wanted to win, dirty tricks were used and what was supposed to be a friendly match turned into an all-out war where each ruler of Xibalba marched his minions against others.

On the surface, the situation isn't much better. The great sky-ball and following flood put the nation of bats into disarray. Bat-caves were flooded and strange frog-like beings were washed into the caves. Many caves and underground passages collapsed and the once united nation was fractured. The seven rulers of Xibalba took over these fractions and formed them into their own image.

Centuries passed and seven new nations are crawling from scattered passages to Xibalba into the overworld. The seven rulers of Xibalba, unable to beat each other in the underworld, decided that the only way they prove their superiority is by conquering the overworld as well. And there is no Pantokrator to stop them.

## Rules
What the lords of Xibalba give, they also take:

* To change a unit, you need to remove a unit.
* To change a commander, you need to remove a commander.
* To change/add a national spell, you need to remove a national spell.

Some changes require more than one unit, commander or spell to be deleted.  
There are limits on how much you can change. The total sum of changes per unit, commander or spells must not be over this limit.

Detailed rules are available [here](doc/rules.md).
