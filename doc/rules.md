# Rules
What the lords of Xibalba give, they also take:

* To change a unit, you need to remove a unit.
* To change a commander, you need to remove a commander.
* To change/add a national spell, you need to remove a national spell.

Some changes require more than one unit, commander or spell to be deleted. \
There are limits on how much you can change. The total sum of changes per unit, commander or spells must not be over this limit.


## National changes:
Each change cost at minimum 1 commander, 1 unit and 1 national spell. Large changes cost 2 of each. National changes should be the most limited ones. Two national changes are permitted. These changes should be documented in national lore.

* Add a small ability (5 fire resist). Only abilities commonly occurring on recruitables can be used and only their minor version. These should be thematic.
* Change a national path for non-national. National paths for frogs and bats are treated separately. National paths for frogs are: WEDN. National paths for bats are BANED.
    * _Changing N for F for bats would turn Way 2N1B->2F1B, but would not influence N randoms on Muuch mages._
* Swap a national path between frogs and bats.
    * _Both frogs and bats have D, N and E. Those cannot be swapped for different magic. Only A, B and W can be swapped this way._
    * _Swapping B for W would change Batab 3W2E1D+1? -> 3B2E1D+1? and Camazotz 2D1B+1? -> 2D1W+1?_
* Swap order between two national paths (e.g., swap N and W on all mages). Frogs and bats are treated separately.
    * Each swap cost one point.
    * _Swapping N and W would change Batab 3W2E1D+1? -> 3N2E1D+1?, Muuch Kuhul 2W1D1E+1? -> 2N1D1E+1?, Ah Itz 1W1E1H -> 1N1E1H and Ah Ha 1D1W -> 1D1N. Both N and W are in randoms and thus random paths are not influenced. Bat mages are treated separately and thus not influenced._
* Change the cap income. The cap income reflects your highest paths: 3 for the highest path, 2 for medium, 1 for the lowest. By default, this is 3W2E1D. Any change in paths (non-national or national swap) will be reflected in the change of cap income automatically. You can change your cap income if it still reflects your highest paths. For default Ma Xib, this might be changing from 3W2E1D into 3W2D1E (Camazotzs have 2D) or 3W2N1B (2N and 1B are available on Way).
* Increase fort technology by a single point. Can be used repeatedly.


## Unit changes:
Each change costs at minimum 1 unit. Some might cost 2. Only three changes are allowed per unit. Changes with increased cost fall into this limit. For example, a unit cannot get both Full Plate Armour and Spetum as each item costs 2 points, which makes the total 4 points, despite there being only two changes.

* Change or add a weapon or shield.
    * Any non-magical, non-innate weapon used by a recruitable unit in any nation is allowed for 1 point.
    * Any magical weapon with the word "Obsidian" in it is eligible for 2 points. \
Spetum and Crossbow are eligible for 2 points.
    * Changing one handed weapon and shield for two handed weapon is considered a single change.
* Change or add an armour or helmet
    * Any non-magical armour used by a recruitable unit in any nation is allowed for 1 point.
    * Armours with protection larger or equal than 15, that is: Full Chain Mail, Bronze Hauberk, Heavy Samurai Armour and Full Scale Archer Armour are eligible for 2 points.
    * Armours with protection larger or equal than 19, notably plate armours such as Full Plate Armour or Plate Hauberk are banned.
* Remove recruitment limitations. For example, making bats recruitable in forts, removing the recruitable limit on bats, making amphibious units recruitable underwater, making units non-cap only.
* Adding or removing sacred status.
* Add a small ability (such as fire resist). Some abilities might be more expensive.
    * Ability commonly present on recruitable nations cost 1 point
    * Ability that is rare or unique to one or a small number of nations cost 2 points.
    * Ability that is a special ability of a single unit or a property of sacred units (fly on bless, shapeshifting, heat auras) cost 2 points.
    * Please, respect the theme of special abilities, size, sacredness or cap-only status.
    * Thematic abilities native to frogs or bats that are rare, yet not particularly strong, as well as other thematic rare, yet not particularly strong, abilities can cost 1 point after discussion.
    * _For example, Zotz can turn into jaguar for 1 point as this ability is thematic, it is present on Way. Zotz turning into werejaguar is not allowed as werejaguar is too big (size 3). For Chak Muuch, it would be 1 point change. Chak Muuch turning into werebear might be too much due to size difference, but it might be allowed for Wo Muuch for 2 points._
* _Adding a mount_
    * _Creatures native to Xibalba or creatures that are commonly used as mounts, cost 1 point._
    * _Creatures non-native to Xibalba or creatures that are not commonly used as mounts cost 2 points. This might change if the mount is thematic and flavourful._
    * _By making a unit mounted, it gains #mounted tag (no armour encumbrance, increase in autocalc gold cost, +3 defense), +2 increase in encumberance, change to combat and map movement according to the creature_
    * _Unit gains either a lance, natural attack from the mount or a second form corresponding to the mount. Additional natural attacks can be bought for an additional 1pt._
    * _In addition to these changes, there might be an additional increase in gold (creature’s upkeep), resources (barding) and recruitment cost (training and taming) depending on the mount._
* _Change the unit chassis from bat to frog or from frog to bat._
    * _Cost is 1pt or 2pt depending on the change._
    * _Size 3 and 4 Shambled chassis are available as is the Onaqui chassis._
    * _Units might get an extra size promotion if changing from larger to a smaller chassis._
* Improve stats such as strength, defence or attack by +2 or precision and health points by +3. 
* Cloning unit. Cloning unit is an exception to the rule and doesn’t count to the unit change limit for the cloned unit or a clone. It still cost a point (unit sacrifice).
    * Clones are made before any modification of the cloned unit, except for national changes.
    * _For example, by sacrificing a Zotz unit, I can make a copy of Wo Muuch. I can still make 3 changes at a normal cost on both original and cloned Wo Muuches. Still, two expensive sacred units are not useful, but I can sacrifice two other units to make one a non-sacred recruit-anywhere unit, while keeping the original as a powerful cap-only sacred._
* Changing the size of a unit by one. Other properties of the unit change as if affected by the effects of Enlarge or Diminuition. Size 2 Muuches can choose to turn into Shamblers instead.
    * Enlarge: +1 Size, +30% HP, +3 Str, -1 Def, +2 Map Move
    * Diminuition: -1 Size, -30% HP, -3 Str, +1 Def, -2 Map Move

## Commander changes:
Each change cost at minimum 1 commander. Some might cost 2. Only three changes are allowed per commander. In addition to the changes identical to the unit changes, commanders can:

* Reshuffle path (3W2E1D ->3D2E1W)
* Change one national path to another national path. Bat/frog limitation applies (3W2E1D+1.1WEDN -> 3N2E1D+1.1WEDN).
* Clone a commander. Unlike with units, cloning of a commander does count to a change limit on both the cloned unit and a clone. Cloning happens before specific changes to the commander, but after national changes.
    * _If I changed my national path W for A during the national changes, my Muuch Kuhul would be 2A1E1D+1AEDN. By sacrificing two other commanders, I can make a clone of this unit and then reshuffle its paths from 2A1E1D+1AEDN Into 2D1E1A+AEDN?. I can make only a single additional change on this commander. However, I can make 2 additional changes on the original commander, for example I could make another clone._


## National spell changes:
Each change costs at minimum 1 national spell. Some might cost 2. Only 3 changes per spell are allowed.

* Add a national spell.
    * National spells from EA/LA Xibalba, Mictlan and Atlantis cost 1 point.
    * National spells from other nations cost 2 points.
    * National spells from other nations are allowed after discussion depending on the flavour of a particular nation.
    * This might change to 1 point if the nation's direction and picked spells thematically fit together and do not suffer from a power creep.
    * _Reasoning: When picking national spells from other nations, try to pick what fits thematically for you and when you do, try to pick a larger roster of such national spells, do not pick only the best spells and summons you can find._
    * _Example: Picking undead lictors, lords of civilization, iron blizzard and Dai Oni is not a very coherent combination of themes and will likely be denied_
* Switch a path of a national spell to a national path of your choice (bat/frog limitation doesn’t apply). If this is the primary path of the spell, this also changes the gems/slaves required for casting.
    * From national path to another national path, the cost is 1 point
    * From non-national path to national path, the cost is 2 points
    * The gem to slave or slave to gem cost is determined on a case by case basis. Assume anything between 2 to 4 slaves per gem and worst case scenario.
    * _Reasoning: Spells non-native to frogs or bats are either harder to obtain or harder to cast. Make sure you are changing your national paths or picking spells you can cast._
* Switch order of primary and secondary path. Blood can never be a secondary path.
    * _For example, change Summon Sacred Scorpion from 1E1D to 1D1E._
    * _For example, change Bind Jaguar Fiend from 1B1F to 1F1B. Another change is required as blood cannot be a secondary path._


## PD and starting army:

* You can swap units in PD and the starting army from the default Ma Xib to modified non-sacred recruit-anywhere units.
* Use 10 Muuch soldiers and/or 20 Zotz soldiers where applicable, both in PD or starting army.
    * _Example: By default, Xibalba PD has 3 types of units that appear in forted provinces: Muuch Warrior #2723, Muuch Warrior #2726 and from PD 20, there is also Zotz Warrior #2734. Both Muuch warriors get one soldier per PD point, while Zotz warriors get 2 soldiers per PD point._
    * _If possible, each PD type should be of a different unit type._
* PD and starting commander is either Muuch Ajaw, Muuch Batab or Zotz Batab. If a modified variant is not present, players can use an unmodified one.
